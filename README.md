# üß† Data Structures Demo Project

Welcome to the **Data Structures Demo**, a C# console application designed to demonstrate how different data structures work in practical scenarios. This project serves as an educational tool, showcasing the functionality, benefits, and use cases of commonly used data structures in C#.

## üìö Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide clear, hands-on examples of how various data structures behave, perform, and can be used in real applications. Each example includes simple, easy-to-follow logic with comments to help you understand **why** a particular structure might be used.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Structures Covered

| Structure     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Array`       | Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.                         |
| `List<T>`     | A resizable, indexed collection ‚Äî part of `System.Collections.Generic`.     |
| `LinkedList<T>` | A doubly linked list that allows efficient insertions and deletions.      |
| `Queue<T>`    | FIFO (First In, First Out) collection ‚Äî good for processing tasks.          |
| `Stack<T>`    | LIFO (Last In, First Out) ‚Äî useful for undo features and parsing.           |
| `HashSet<T>`  | An unordered collection of unique elements ‚Äî fast lookups and set logic.    |
| `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` | Key-value pair structure for efficient lookups.                |
